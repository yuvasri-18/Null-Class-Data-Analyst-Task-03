Created a dual-axis chart that shows the number of media views and media engagements by the day of the week for the last quarter. Highlight days with significant spikes in media interactions. this graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST and 7 AM to 11AM apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself and the tweet impression should be even number and tweet date should be odd number as well as tweet character count should be above 30 and need to remove tweet word which has letter 'H'
